# Grid-Query-Challenge
Building a single page that adapts to where itâ€™s viewed. 

It is built-in responsive design; the page will swap to the mobile mode when the width of the display is less than 550 pixels. 
The page also contains a printer-friendly media state that removes all external borders and gets rid of the navigation bar as well.
